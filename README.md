### Getting started

First things first, you'll need to fork or clone this repository, and run the install command of your choosing (preferrably Yarn):

```
npm install
```

And that's really about it (see, I said it was simple!). To fire up the server and have it do stuff, you'll need to start it with the familiar command:

```
npm start
```

### Accessing the server and returning data

The server should be running by now, and you can visit `http://localhost:3001` to see it in action.
